## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

* `PORT` - Server port (default: 3080), you can change it in the server.js file as you prefer

### Docker Socket

The application requires access to the Docker socket. Ensure Docker is running and the socket is accessible:

**Linux/macOS:**

```bash
ls -la /var/run/docker.sock
```

**Windows (WSL):**

```bash
# Ensure Docker Desktop is running
docker ps
```

## 🚦 Usage

### Basic Operations

1. **Select Server**: Use the dropdown menu to choose a local or remote server
2. **View Containers**: See all containers for the selected server
3. **Start/Stop**: Use the buttons to manage containers as usual
4. **Edit Container**: Click the pencil icon to change name or icon

### Container Customization

1. Click the edit icon (pencil) on any container card
2. Upload a custom icon (image files only)
3. Set a custom name for easier identification
4. Click "Save" to apply changes

### Server Management

1. Click the server selector dropdown
2. Select "Add Server" to configure a new remote Docker server
3. Use the edit or delete options to manage existing servers
4. Server data is persisted and automatically loaded on startup

### Status Indicators

* 🟢 **Green**: Container is running
* 🔴 **Red**: Container is stopped

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Network Security

* **Deploy behind VPN**: Ensure the application is only accessible through a secure VPN connection
* **Internal Network**: Use only in trusted internal networks

### File Upload Security

* Only image files are accepted for container icons
* Files are stored in the `public/assets/` directory

### Docker Access

* The application requires Docker socket access
* All VPN users will have full container management capabilities
* Consider Docker socket security best practices

## 🚨 Limitations

* **No User Authentication**: All users have the same access level
* **No Audit Logging**: Container operations are not logged
* **Local Storage**: Settings are stored in local JSON files
* **Single Instance**: Not designed for multi-instance deployment

## 🛌 Multi-Server Support

As of **v1.1.0**, FastDock supports managing containers across multiple Docker hosts. Key points:

* Add servers with custom name, address, and port
* Switch between servers using the dropdown selector
* View and manage containers per-server
* Each container shows the server it belongs to
* Full backwards compatibility with single-server setups
* Server list and settings are persisted locally
